# Leetcode using C

   I've started using leetcode to learn Data Structer and Algorithm.
   
   Most of the solutions were coded in ```C```, partly beacause I was learning this programming language during the course at university.
   
   Some of them have been added solution using ```Java``` or ```C++``` (or even ```assembly language``` :D).
   
   Hope you enjoy it! If you have any contribution, don't hesitate to contact me at email address: haivietb9@gmail.com.
