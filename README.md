# Leetcode using C

### Welcome to my Leetcode challenge

   I've started using leetcode to learn Data Structer and Algorithm.
   
   Most of the solutions were coded in ```C```, partly beacause I was learning this programming language during the course at university.
   
   Some of them have been added solutions using ```Java``` or ```C++``` (or even ```assembly language``` :D).
   
   Hope you enjoy it! If you have any contribution, don't hesitate to contact me at email address: haivietb9@gmail.com.

   __Notice:__ All solutions are only used to submit on Leetcode with appropriate programming language. If you want to compileode using C
